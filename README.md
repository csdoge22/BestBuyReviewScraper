# Best Buy Review Scraper
This was project 2 from my CSC 360 - Computer Networking class.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to scrape reviews of a given product. I chose to scrape all reviews of the "ASUS - ROG Zephyrus G16 16" OLED 240Hz Gaming Laptop - Intel Core Ultra 9 - 32GB LPDDR5X - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 - 2TB SSD - Eclipse Gray". There are a couple bad apples out there that like to give dishonest ratings, so this program using Natural Language Processing to estimate genuine ratings numbers for each rating.

## How to Use
1. Go to the best buy site and choose a product
2. Substitute the base URL with the URL that leads to the product
3. Run the program in your favorite IDE, whether that be VSCode, vim and the command line, or PyCharm

## Technologies Used
1. Selenium (Web Scraping)
2. Python (Main programming language used to code the scraper)
3. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit

## Future Insights
1. Improve the algorithm for determining an accurate rating based on what words are there (Regular Expressions and Edit Distance)
2. Create a backend server that allows users to find ratings based on ANY product being searched (on-demand)
